        <p>In today’s fast-paced, digital world, social media has become one of the most popular ways for young people to connect, learn, and be entertained. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, and Discord have millions of young users, many of them under the age of 18. While these platforms offer opportunities for creativity and friendships, they also expose underage people to a number of serious risks that are often underestimated or ignored.</p>
      
        <p>The online world isn’t always a safe place. Young people are vulnerable to threats such as cyberbullying, online predators, identity theft, exposure to harmful or violent content, and peer pressure through social media trends. Many kids and teens don’t fully understand the long-term consequences of sharing personal information, photos, or videos with strangers online.</p>
      
        <p>Recent statistics paint a worrying picture. According to the Australian eSafety Commissioner:</p>
      
        <p>67% of young people aged 12–17 have experienced negative online experiences, including bullying, harassment, or being contacted by strangers.</p>
      
        <p>36% of young Australians admitted to having contact with someone they had never met in real life while gaming or on social media.</p>
      
        <p>1 in 5 young people have been exposed to inappropriate or distressing content, like violent videos or offensive messages, while online.</p>
      
        <p>Globally, the risks are just as severe:</p>
      
        <p>It’s estimated that over 500,000 online predators are active daily.</p>
      
        <p>The Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation (ACCCE) reported a 122% increase in reports of online child exploitation material during the COVID-19 pandemic, with numbers still rising.</p>
      
        <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) links prolonged social media use in young people to rising rates of anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and low self-esteem.</p>
      
        <p><strong>Why is this happening?</strong></p>
      
        <p>Young people often lack the life experience and critical judgement needed to detect unsafe or suspicious behaviour online. Social media platforms are designed to be addictive, with constant notifications and trending content keeping users hooked for longer. Algorithms may even accidentally expose young users to harmful material based on their interests or activity.</p>
