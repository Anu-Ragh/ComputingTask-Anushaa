            Preventing underage people from misusing social media starts with awareness and smart boundaries. First, parents and guardians should be actively involved — this means setting age-appropriate restrictions, using parental control tools, and having open conversations about online safety.
            <br><br>
            Social media apps should also enforce age limits properly by improving their age verification processes. Schools can help by teaching digital literacy — kids need to know how to recognise scams, protect their privacy, and understand that not everything online is real.
            <br><br>
            Finally, it’s important to encourage real-life activities and balance. Too much time online can affect mental health, sleep, and relationships. By promoting offline hobbies and setting screen time rules, we create a safer, healthier environment for young people to grow up in — both online and offline.
